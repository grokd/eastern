# Eastern

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.6.

This is an attempt to "appify" my current studies in eastern mysticism.

## Development Progress

Currently there is base level functionality, and selecting a suitable hex and pressing the button will return an object with the reading data in the console.

## Install

Run `npm i` to install the project's node files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng serve` to initialize a local server.
